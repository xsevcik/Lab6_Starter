I decided to try it today so that I could do something else for Thanksgiving if it failed but..I'm so excited!!It looked beautiful coming out of the oven and the smell was divine. I made leaves to decorate it and glazed them with egg white and sugar to edge the pie.It looked so lovely, I was so proud of it but it didn't look a tenth as good as it tasted! Thank you for a wonderful recipe, a fantastic first ever time baking such an all American classic and even better - I get to make another on Wednesday for Thanksgiving dinner!!!
