Add a teaspoon of sugar and continue to beat until they reach stiff peaks. Gently fold into eggnog. Note that because of the salmonella risk from raw eggs, it is recommended that children, elderly, and people with compromised immune systems refrain from eating raw eggs such as the optional whipped egg whites in this recipe, unless you use pasteurized eggs. You can also reheat the combined eggnog and egg white mixture until it reaches 160Â°F, then remove from heat and let cool, then chill. The mixture will lose some of its fluffiness from the beaten egg whites, but not all, and the eggnog will be much airier than without the egg whites."

I had the heat on medium, which ended up being too hot and curdled the eggs, but a hand blender saved the day - thanks for the tip! It ended up tasting delicious, and we made it a few more times with different variations. My kids like it better without the egg whites mixed in. A terrific, carefully explained recipe that even a nervous novice could follow. Thank you!"

It's also even better if you leave it to chill over night so all the spices can really steep into the eggnog. 5/5 and a new Christmas tradition for us!"
