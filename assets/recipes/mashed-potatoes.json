        "5 lb. russet or Yukon Gold potatoes",
        "3/4 c. butter",
        "1 package (8 oz.) cream cheese, softened",
        "1/2 c. (to 3/4 cups) half-and-half",
        "1/2 tsp. <p>(to 1 teaspoon) Lawry's Seasoned Salt</p>",
        "1/2 tsp. <p>(to 1 teaspoon) black pepper</p>"

    "recipeInstructions": "Peel and cut the potatoes into pieces that are generally the same size. Bring a large pot of water to a simmer and add the potatoes.  Bring to a boil and cook for 30 to 35 minutes. When they’re cooked through, the fork should easily slide into the potatoes with no resistance, and the potatoes should almost, but not totally, fall apart. Drain the potatoes in a large colander. When the potatoes have finished draining, place them back into the dry pot and put the pot on the stove.  Mash the potatoes over low heat, allowing all the steam to escape, before adding in all the other ingredients. Turn off the stove and add 1 ½ sticks of butter, an 8-ounce package of cream cheese and about ½ cup of half-and-half. Mash, mash, mash! Next, add about ½ teaspoon of Lawry’s Seasoning Salt and ½ a teaspoon of black pepper. Stir well and place in a medium-sized baking dish. Throw a few pats of butter over the top of the potatoes and place them in a 350-degree oven and heat until butter is melted and potatoes are warmed through. <br>",

We love our cheese mashed into the potato too..   In fact mashed potato any way is manna from heaven..  We don't do Thanks Giving here (Australia) - any day is Mashed Spud Day for me.  Another trick is to cook some pumpkin with the spuds and it becomes 'Golden Mashed Potato'..  Very yummy.  Go easy on the milk if you use pumpkin - can make it too mushy.",
